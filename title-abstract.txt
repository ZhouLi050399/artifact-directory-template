Title:
COVID-19 Sentiment and Daily ases Analysis on Social Media

Abstract:
Covid-19 changed everyone, from the way we interact, to how we work, and our methods of communication, especially through social media. Throughout the studying of 
this quarter, we noticed that there are numbers of posts in our Twitter dataset that are related to the topic of covid-19 having some strong emotions and 
sentiments. Therefore, this project starts with the investigation by using the “covid-19 tweets” dataset obtained from the Panacea Lab and performing sentiment 
analysis on its tweet text. Since this tweets dataset is without sentiment labels, from the Kaggle website, we finally found a dataset that contains 1.6 million 
training data with text and sentiment labels attributes. In the methodology part, we trained the default logistic regression model as the baseline model, and the 
SVC model as the advanced model to predict sentiment labels of “covid-19 tweets” dataset. Then, we detrended the daily case data and performed multiple analyses 
including correlation and Fourier transformation to study its relationship with the sentiment score.
