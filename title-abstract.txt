Title:
COVID-19 Sentiment and Daily ases Analysis on Social Media

Abstract:
With the unexpected impact of Covid-19, drastic changes were induced to people’s health, lifestyle, and mentality. During the research last quarter, we noticed that
the majority of posts in our Twitter dataset have strong emotions and sentiments. Therefore, this project starts with the investigation by using the “covid-19 
tweets” dataset obtained from the Panacea Lab and sentiment analysis on its tweet text. Since this tweets dataset is without sentiment labels, from the Kaggle 
website, we found a dataset that contains 1.6 million training data with text and sentiment labels attributes. In the methodology part, we trained the default 
logistic regression model as the baseline model, and the SVC model as the advanced model to predict sentiment labels of “covid-19 tweets” dataset. 

In this project, we trained our SVC tweet sentiment model using a dataset that contains 1.6 million data with text and sentiment labels from Kaggle. The model is 
then used to predict daily sentiment scores in the time period same as our daily cases data. After that, we detrended the daily case data and performed multiple 
analyses including correlation, cointegration test, and Fourier transformation to study its relationship with the sentiment score.
