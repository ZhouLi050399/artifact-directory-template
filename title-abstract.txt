Title:
COVID-19 Sentiment and Daily ases Analysis on Social Media

Abstract:
With the unexpected impact of Covid-19, drastic changes were induced to peopleâ€™s health, lifestyle, and mentality. During the research last quarter, we noticed that 
the majority of posts in our Twitter dataset have strong emotions and sentiments. In this project, we trained our SVC tweet sentiment model using a dataset that 
contains 1.6 million data with text and sentiment labels from Kaggle. The trained model is used to predict sentiment scores on the daily tweets sampled from the 
Panacea Lab dataset. After that, we detrended the daily case data and performed multiple analyses including correlation, cointegration test, and Fourier 
transformation to study its relationship with the sentiment score.
